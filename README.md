# PyBer_Analysis
Creating for PyBer Module

##Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of the PyBer Analysis was to analyze data related to riders, drivers and the cost per far for both. To do this we had to combine two seperate data sets, one containing city data and the other containing ride data. By combining these data frames we were able to create our own new data frame to help provide a better analysis to PybBer. The combined data set also allowed us to put together useful data visualizations to help us understand the large data sets and also help illustrate visually what we found. Using the multi-line graph chart we were able to visual the total weekly fares for each city type during the requested time period (January 1st to April 29th 2019). All of this helped me to provide PyBer CEO with the below reccomendations

##Results
By combining data sets I was able to produce the below overview to help summarize my findings. The below visual can also be found in the resourcs folder if it is needed for any other presentations.

-Urban cities have more riders and drivers than any other city locations
  -While Urban cities do have highest amount of riders, you can see they have too many drivers
 -Suburban cities have decent rider demand but are understaffed by drivers
  -Because Suburban cities have decent demand and not enough drivers the drivers make more than 2x what they do in Urban cities 
 -Rural Cities have the lowest amount of riders and drivers
  -Due to lack of demand and supply the avg fare in Rural Areas cost the most 
  -For this same reason of low supply and demand drivers also make the most per fare
  -One thing that is not taken into account in our data is ride length. I do wonder if Rural ride length likely being longer also plays into the higher fare cost

##**Summary**
 Overall we see a correlation that more drivers is better for the rider and less drivers is better for the drivers. As far as PyBer my reccomendation would be the following 
 -From a Revenue perspective for PyBer the obvious takeaway is that more drivers to match rider demand is going to equal more total revenue for PyBer
 -Increase drivers in Rural cities, by doing this PyBer can satisfy the needs of their riders. 
  -PyBer should share the Avg Fare per Driver in Rural Areas as a way to recruit new drivers to meet rider demand
 -This same logic could be applied to Suburban areas as well where drivers make more than 2x those in Urban areas.
